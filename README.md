### Hi, I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with a passion for software design, collaboration and innovation. Some of my interests include research data engineering, in-memory data flow, and scientific software.

I've been on Github for {{ ACCOUNT_AGE }} years. During that time I've contributed to {{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }} repositories, opened {{ ISSUES }} issues, performed {{ CODE_REVIEWS }} code reviews, and have opened {{ PULL_REQUESTS }} pull requests.
